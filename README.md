Created a file containing a list of 5 of my favourite fruits. Then used the random module to choose a random fruit from the list. Asked the user for a single letter input. 

Created an if statement which checked the user input whether it is a single letter and whether it was a letter and not a value. Incorporated an else statement which prints a message indicating the input was not valid.
