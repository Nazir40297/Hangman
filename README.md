# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Created a file containing a list of 5 of my favourite fruits. Then used the random module to choose a random fruit from the list. Asked the user for a single letter input. 

Created an if statement which checked the user input whether it is a single letter and whether it was a letter and not a value. Incorporated an else statement which prints a message indicating the input was not valid.

A new file was made which incorporates the functions needed to check the guesses. A while loop was made so the code runs continuously. The user was asked for an input within this while loop. The guess was converted into lowercase. 

2 functions were created namely check_guess and ask_for_input whereby the two loops were included. The check_guess was called in the ask_for_input function and tested outside to make sure the code worked.
